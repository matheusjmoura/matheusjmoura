### Hi there! 👋

My name is Matheus José de Moura from Brazil (🇧🇷). I study Computer Engineering at [UTFPR - Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná](http://portal.utfpr.edu.br/). I'm passionate about software development and I've always loved to produce a lot of content during my learning.

In my free time I like to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me?
